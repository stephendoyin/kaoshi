        not <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> has been informed
        of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
        disclaimer of warranties or limitation of liability in certain
        circumstances. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply
        to you.<br />‍<br /><strong>11. Governing.</strong> These Terms are
        governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
        conflict of law principles. Subject to Section 12, which provides that
        disputes are to be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims
        court, to the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted
        hereunder, you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> agree to submit to the
        exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts
        located within Delaware, for the purpose of litigating all such
        disputes. We operate the Services from our offices in Delaware, and we
        make no representation that information and materials included in the
        Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.<br /><br /><strong
          >12. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</strong
        >; Class Action Waiver. In the interest of resolving disputes between
        you and <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims
        court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (“Agreement to
        Arbitrate”). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
        Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows
        for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited
        review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that
        a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on
        an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
        permitted. You acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award
        relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in
        favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
        necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party’s
        claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.

          >YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND KAOSHI

      <p class="text-paragraph">
        a) Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration. You and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> agree to arbitrate all
        disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended
        to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims
        arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us,
        whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
        any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior
        Terms; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
        litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
        claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.<br /><br />b)
        Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 12(A), you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> agree that no
        statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit
        either party’s right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims
        court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal,
        state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek
        injunctive relief in any competent court of law; or (iv) to file suit in
        a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.<br /><br />c)
        Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> will be governed by
        the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary
        Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of
        the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these
        Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing
        forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Kaoshi.<br /><br />d) Notice and
        Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
        other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The
        Notice to <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> should be
        addressed to: <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> Inc.,
        1451 East 55th street, Chicago, Illinois 60615, United States of America
        (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of
        the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
        (“Demand”). If you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> do not reach an
        agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is
        received, you or <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> may
        commence an arbitration proceeding.<br /><br />e) Fees. In the event
        that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms,
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> will, at your request,
        reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless
        your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any
        fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any request for payment of fees
        by
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for
        Arbitration and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In
        the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the
        arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as
        measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        11(b)), you agree to reimburse
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> for all fees
        associated with the arbitration paid by
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> on your behalf that
        you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.<br /><br />If
        your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
        arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted
        to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or
        by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Any in-person
        arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in
        the state of Delaware. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
        is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
        sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
        the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
        rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees
        or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from
        either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the
        merits.<br /><br />f) No Class Actions. Unless both you and
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
        person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
        representative or class proceeding.

        <strong
          >YOU AND <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> AGREE THAT
          EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
          CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
          OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong

      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraph">
        g) Opt-Out. If you are a new
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> user, you can choose
        to reject the arbitration agreement contained in this Section 12
        (“opt-out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”).
        The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days
        after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must mail
        the Opt-Out Notice to the Notice Address listed in Section 12(D),
        above.<br /><br />The Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address
        (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user
        name(s) and email address(es) associated with the
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> account(s) to which
        the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be
        effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the
        Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate,
        all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out
        of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or
        future arbitration agreements that you may have with Kaoshi.<br /><br />h)
        Modifications. If
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> makes any future
        change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the Notice
        Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice
        within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. You
        acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change,
        your account with
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> shall be immediately
        terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance
        with the language of this provision.<br /><br />i) Severability and
        Enforceability. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this
        Section 12 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section
        12 shall still apply. If the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be
        unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction
        and venue described in Section 11 shall govern any action arising out of
        or related to these Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will
        continue to apply.<br /><br /><strong
          >13. Modification of the Services.</strong
        >
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently,
        some or all of the Services at any time without any notice or further
        obligation to you. You agree that
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> will not be liable to
        you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or
        discontinuance of any of the Services.<br /><br /><strong
          >14. General.<br /><br /></strong
        >a) Entire Agreement. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy
        constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between
        you and <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span> regarding your
        use of and access to the Services, and except as expressly permitted
        above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized
        representatives of the parties.<br /><br />b) No Waiver. The failure to
        require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to
        require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any
        breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent
        breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.<br /><br />c)
        Paragraph Headers. Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for
        convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of
        particular provisions.<br /><br />d) Severability. In the event that any
        part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
        unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible
        and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.<br /><br />e)
        Partner Terms. In some instances, Kaoshi’s third party partners require
        that
        <span class="tm">&nbsp;Kaoshi&trade;&nbsp;</span>
        users agree to be bound by some additional terms of use that are
        specific to particular products or services (“Partner Terms”). In the
        event of any conflict between the Partner Terms and Kaoshi’s Terms of
        Use, Kaoshi’s Terms of Use are overarching.
